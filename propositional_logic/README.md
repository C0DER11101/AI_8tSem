# Problem statement

**Write a program which takes a propositional logic sentence as input with maximum of 3 propositions including the truth values**
**of the proposition and generates the truth value of the sentence of the output.**

# <ins>Procedure for testing the validity of an argument using truth table</ins>

1. Identify the premises and conclusion of the argument.
2. Construct a truth table showing the truth values of all premises and the conclusion.
3. Find the rows(called **critical rows**) in which all the premises are true.
4. In each critical row, determine whether the conclusion of the argument is also true.
	1. If in each critical row the conclusion is also true, then the argument form is valid.
	2. If there is at least one critical row in which the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid.
